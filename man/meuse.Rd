\title{Meuse river data set}
\description{
This data set gives locations and topsoil heavy metal concentrations, along with a number of soil and landscape variablesat the observation locations, collected in a flood plain of the river Meuse, near the village of Stein (NL). Data were extracted from the sp package and converted to latitude and longitude format.
}
\format{
  This data frame contains the following columns:
  \describe{
    \item{x}{a numeric vector; Easting (m) in Rijksdriehoek (RDH)
    (Netherlands topographical) map coordinates }
    \item{y}{a numeric vector; Northing (m) in RDH  coordinates }
	\item{cadmium}{topsoil cadmium concentration, mg kg-1 soil ('ppm'); zero cadmium
	values in the original data set have been shifted to 0.2 (half the lowest 
	non-zero value) }
	\item{copper}{topsoil copper concentration, mg kg-1 soil  ('ppm') }
	\item{lead}{topsoil lead concentration, mg kg-1 soil  ('ppm') }
	\item{zinc}{topsoil zinc concentration, mg kg-1 soil  ('ppm') } 
	\item{elev}{relative elevation above local river bed, m }
	\item{dist}{distance to the Meuse; obtained from the nearest cell in
	\link{meuse.grid}, which in turn was derived by a spread (spatial distance)
	GIS operation, horizontal precision 20 metres; then
	normalized to $[0,1]$ }
	\item{om}{organic matter, kg (100 kg)-1 soil (percent)}
	\item{ffreq}{flooding frequency class: 1 = once in two years; 2 = once in ten years; 3 = one in 50 years}
	\item{soil}{soil type according to the 1:50 000 soil map of the Netherlands. 1 = Rd10A (Calcareous weakly-developed meadow soils, light sandy clay); 2 = Rd90C/VII (Non-calcareous weakly-developed meadow soils, heavy sandy clay to light clay); 3 = Bkd26/VII (Red Brick soil, fine-sandy, silty light clay)}
	\item{lime}{lime class: 0 = absent, 1 = present by field test with 5\% HCl}
	\item{landuse}{landuse class: Aa  Agriculture/unspecified = , Ab = Agr/sugar beetsm, Ag = Agr/small grains, Ah = Agr/??, Am = Agr/maize, B = woods, Bw  = trees in pasture, DEN = ??, Fh = tall fruit trees, Fl = low fruit trees; Fw = fruit trees in pasture, Ga = home gardens, SPO = sport field, STA = stable yard, Tv = ??
, W = pasture}
	\item{dist.m}{distance to river Meuse in metres, as obtained during the field survey}

\usage{
data(meuse)
}
\note{row.names refer to the original sample number.

Soil units were mapped with a minimum delination width of 150 m, and so somewhat generalize the landscape.

Approximate equivalent World Reference Base 2002 for Soil Resources names are: Rd10A Gleyic Fluvisols; Rd90C Haplic Fluvisols; Bkd26 Haplic Luvisols. Units Rd90C and Bkd26 have winter groundwater > 80cm, summer > 120cm depth.
